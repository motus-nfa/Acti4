Developed by the National Research Centre for the Working Environment in Copenhagen.


The Acti4 program is a Matlab script for analysis of data recorded by ActiGraph (AG) model GT3Xplus, Axivity model AX3, ActivPAL or Sens accelerometers and an ActiHeart (AH) or a Bod-yguard2 (Firstbeat) monitor for heart rate recording. The input data are typically recorded by a set of accelerometer units attached to the thigh, hip, arm and trunk during several days (e.g. 7 days) and AH data for 3-4 days. The output data includes analysis of activity type (lying, sitting, standing, walking etc.), arm and trunk inclination and heart rate load for selected periods of work and leisure.

### Documentation


#### Legacy
Acti4 has reached its final version (v2007). We have decided not to pursue further development or updates for this software, as we are focusing on developing the python based system called Motus instead (link below). Please note, while there will be no new updates, the current version will remain available for download and use.
