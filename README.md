# Acti4
Developed by the National Research Centre for the Working Environment in Copenhagen.


The Acti4 program is a Matlab script for analysis of data recorded by ActiGraph (AG) model GT3Xplus, Axivity model AX3, ActivPAL or Sens accelerometers and an ActiHeart (AH) or a Bod-yguard2 (Firstbeat) monitor for heart rate recording. The input data are typically recorded by a set of accelerometer units attached to the thigh, hip, arm and trunk during several days (e.g. 7 days) and AH data for 3-4 days. The output data includes analysis of activity type (lying, sitting, standing, walking etc.), arm and trunk inclination and heart rate load for selected periods of work and leisure.
